# csvtodb
A simple python script which directly feeds contents of a .csv file into mysql database

You will need to install the modules csv and pymysql if you dont already have them.
    Hint: try pip

You will mostly need to edit stuff written in caps

CSV file should have headings, same headings should be used in the python code

You will need to pre-create the MySQL db, the column names should be appropriately replaced in the script
